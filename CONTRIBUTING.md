## Setup for local development
1. **Fork the repository** 
    Create your own copy of the repository by forking the repository.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```
   This will compile the code, run tests, and produce build artifacts.

4. **Code style / formatting**
   * Follow the existing code style (indentation, braces, naming)

5. **Testing**
   * Add unit tests for new features/bug fixes
   * Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request

6. **Commit / Branching Workflow**
   * Create a feature or bugfix branch from `main` named like `feature/xyz` or `bugfix/abc`
   * Make your changes, ensure tests pass locally
   * Write a clear commit message summarising the changes
   * Push your branch to your fork and open a Pull Request (PR) into the `main` branch of this repo
